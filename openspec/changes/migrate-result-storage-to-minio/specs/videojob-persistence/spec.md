## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: PostgreSQL Repository Implements VideoJobRepository

`internal/video/infrastructure/postgres.Repository` SHALL implement `domain.VideoJobRepository`'s `Create`, `FindByID`, `FindByUserID`, and `FindCompletedByUserID` against a `video_jobs` table, using parameterized queries and reconstructing `*domain.VideoJob` via `domain.RestoreVideoJob` from stored rows.

`FindCompletedByUserID` SHALL restrict to `completed` jobs **in the query**, applying its offset and limit to the already-filtered result set. Filtering after pagination would let a page of recent `pending`/`failed` jobs displace a user's completed results out of the listing entirely, so the ordering-then-limiting must happen over completed rows only. It SHALL otherwise order identically to `FindByUserID`: `CreatedAt` descending with `VideoJobID` ascending as a tie-breaker.

`internal/video/infrastructure/cache.CachedVideoJobRepository` SHALL pass `FindCompletedByUserID` straight through to the decorated repository without caching it, exactly as it already does for `FindByUserID` — the status cache is keyed by individual job ID and has nothing to offer a multi-row listing.

#### Scenario: A created job round-trips through FindByID

- **GIVEN** a `VideoJob` persisted via `Repository.Create`
- **WHEN** `Repository.FindByID` is called with that job's ID
- **THEN** it returns a `*domain.VideoJob` with the same `ID`, `UserID`, `OriginalFilename`, `StorageKey`, `FrameCount`, `ErrorReason`, `Status`, and `CreatedAt`

#### Scenario: FindByID reports not-found for an unknown ID

- **GIVEN** no `VideoJob` exists for a given ID
- **WHEN** `Repository.FindByID` is called with that ID
- **THEN** it returns `domain.ErrVideoJobNotFound`

#### Scenario: FindByUserID orders by CreatedAt descending

- **GIVEN** `VideoJob`s persisted for the same `UserID` with distinct `CreatedAt` values
- **WHEN** `Repository.FindByUserID` is called
- **THEN** the returned jobs are ordered newest-`CreatedAt`-first

#### Scenario: FindByUserID orders and paginates via the stored index

- **GIVEN** multiple `VideoJob`s persisted for the same `UserID`, some with equal `CreatedAt` values
- **WHEN** `Repository.FindByUserID` is called with an offset and limit
- **THEN** the returned jobs are ordered by `CreatedAt` descending with `VideoJobID` ascending as a tie-breaker, bounded by the given offset and limit — matching the ordering `videojob-lifecycle`'s `ListUserJobs` requirement documents

#### Scenario: FindCompletedByUserID returns only completed jobs

- **GIVEN** a `UserID` with jobs in `pending`, `processing`, `failed`, and `completed` statuses
- **WHEN** `Repository.FindCompletedByUserID` is called
- **THEN** only the `completed` jobs are returned

#### Scenario: Non-completed jobs do not consume the page

- **GIVEN** a `UserID` whose most recently created jobs are all non-`completed`, with `completed` jobs older than them
- **WHEN** `Repository.FindCompletedByUserID` is called with an offset of 0 and a limit smaller than the number of non-completed jobs
- **THEN** the completed jobs are returned, rather than an empty page

#### Scenario: FindCompletedByUserID is scoped to its user

- **GIVEN** `completed` jobs belonging to two different users
- **WHEN** `Repository.FindCompletedByUserID` is called for one of them
- **THEN** only that user's jobs are returned
